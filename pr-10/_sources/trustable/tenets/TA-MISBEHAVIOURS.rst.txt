TA-MISBEHAVIOURS
#################

Overview
--------

The TA-MISBEHAVIOURS documentation provides a detailed exploration of identifying, analyzing, and resolving misbehaviors within the Trustable Software Framework. This section outlines the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes related to misbehavior assessment. Further reading can be found `here <https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/doorstop/TA.html#ta-misbehaviours>`_

Objectives
----------

- Identify and define potential misbehaviors in software systems.
- Assess the impact and risk associated with non-compliant behaviors.
- Document procedures for testing, diagnosing, and mitigating misbehaviors.

Methodology
-----------

1. **Misbehavior Identification**
   - Catalog potential misbehaviors within software components.
   - Align misbehaviors with trust criteria and impact factors.

2. **Assessment Procedures**
   - Develop tests to detect and evaluate misbehaviors.
   - Specify input conditions, expected failures or deviations, and test scenarios.

3. **Diagnostics and Mitigation**
   - Execute tests and document anomalies.
   - Diagnose root causes of misbehaviors and propose mitigation strategies.

Test Cases
----------

.. code-block:: c++

    // Example test case for misbehavior detection
    void test_misbehavior_abc() {
        // Set up adverse conditions
        // Call function
        // Verify discrepancy in expected outcome
    }

Results
-------

- Documented findings of misbehavior tests.
- Analysis of the impact and consequences of identified misbehaviors.
- Recommendations for addressing and mitigating critical issues.

Conclusion
----------

The TA-MISBEHAVIOURS framework enhances software trustability by systematically identifying, assessing, and resolving misbehaviors. Through rigorous testing and analysis, the framework contributes to the development of secure and dependable software solutions.
