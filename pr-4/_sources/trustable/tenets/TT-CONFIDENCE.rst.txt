Guidance

Our overall objective is to deliver releases of XYZ that meet our expectations and do not cause harm. By collecting and assessing evidence for all of the factors above, we aim to assess (ideally measure) confidence in each release candidate, to support go/nogo decision-making, In assessing confidence we need to consider various categories of evidence including:

subjective (e.g. provenance, reviews and approvals)

binary (e.g. test pass/fail)

stochastic (e.g. scheduling test results over time)

empirical (e.g. advance warning signal monitoring data from production deployments)
