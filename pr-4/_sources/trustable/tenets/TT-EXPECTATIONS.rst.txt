Guidance

While most modern software is developed without a formal requirement/specification process, we need to be clear about what we expect from XYZ, communicate these expectations, and verify that they are met.

In most (almost all?) cases, we need to verify our expectations by tests. These tests must be automated and applied for every candidate release of XYZ.

It is not sufficient to demonstrate that the software does what we expect. We also need to analyse the potential risks in our scenario, identify unacceptable and/or dangerous misbehaviours and verify that they are absent, prevented or mitigated.

In most cases it is not sufficient to demonstrate behaviours and mitigations only in a factory/laboratory environment. We also need to establish methods for monitoring critical behaviours and misbehaviours in production, and methods for taking appropriate action based on advance warning signals of potential misbehaviour.
