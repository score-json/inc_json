Guidance

We need to perform tests to verify expected behaviours and properties of XYZ in advance of every candidate release.

We also need to validate these tests, to confirm that they do actually test for the expected behaviours or properties, and that test failures are properly detected. Usually this can be done by inducting software faults to exercise the tests and checking that the results record the expected failure.

Similarly we need to verify that prevention measures and mitigations continue to work for each XYZ candidate release, and in production.

All these validated test results and monitored advance warning signal data from production must be collected and analysed on an ongoing basis. We need to notice when results or trends in advance warning signals change, and react appropriately.
